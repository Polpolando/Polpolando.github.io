      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Hello, I am Michael (Micha≈Ç, he/they, 18, bisexual, white, pol/eng, autistic, twink), I go by Polando on the internet and I'd prefer if you used that instead of my real name. I am a polish high-school student that's really interested in technology (mainly computers), music, video games and other internet stuff. I'm trying to get competent in programming and other computer stuff.</p>

      <h4>Media</h4>
      <p>I'm a fan of homestuck, tf2, boomer shooters, linux and other nerd stuff. <br>
      The main reason I made this site in plain html+css+js is because it's just more fun to me, others might've used carrd or some other tool to make it look pretty and easy and stuff but I like it doing this way.</p>
      <p>I'm a big fan of prog rock, emo, post rock, breakcore and other more experimental genres, although I don't like all of it. <br>
      My favorite artists are: Caligula's horse, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Angelmaker and few others that I can't name from the top of my head.</p>

      <h4>My computers</h4>
      <p>As weird as it sounds I do believe my computer is a part of my personality now, I've been using computers since i was a little kid, I definitely remember using the internet when I was 4 but I probably was offline since i was 3 or less. <br>
      My first computer that I remember was some crappy computer built by my uncle that I was really really looking up towards. He always helped me with computers, installed games and was just basically awesome. That computer wasn't really the best but it helped me grow my love for old and indie games. <br>
      I've built my first proper PC in 2016 just before the GPU crash, I've been using this computer for 4 years now as of the date that I'm writing this. <br>
      I've installed linux on it in December 2020, <a href="/img/rice1.png" >here is a screenshot of my rice</a><br>
      I've been improving upon it since the beginning, It grew a little bit bloated and kinda janky but hey, as long as it works I ain't switching. I've never really been a fan of distrohopping.
      I don't have a real reason to use linux, I just think it's really fun. I don't play many games anymore but that's fine, I've learned to enjoy configuring my programs, programming and other nerd stuff. 
      </p>

      <h4>Contact and other externals</h4>
      <p>You can contact me through discord: PoIando#1137, that's where I spend most of my time.</p>
