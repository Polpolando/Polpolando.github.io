      <h4><a href="./term">Little site that's supposed to emulate a terminal</a></h4>
      <p>
      This is just a terminal I made that I wanted to turn into my about page kinda but most people wouldn't be able to use it so it's here now. <br>
      It only has a few working commands which you can check by typing `help` into the prompt. I probably didn't even implement the `help` command so yeah it's just there collecting dust n stuff.

      <h4><a href="./old_page">My first github.io page</a></h4>
      <p>
      I do believe it looks way better and more modern but honestly I prefer the look and feel of old static webpages. Some day in the future they will all be gone. <br>
      It contains some info about me in a way more condensed form, but I'm not a fan of that approach anymore. It has a few hidden hyperlinks that'll lead you to more fun pages

      <h4><a href="./karls_site">Karl's intro website</a></h4>
      <p>
      A website I made for Karl after he showed me a shitty carrd someone made for him. <br>
      I used the XP.css library to replicate the windows xp style. <br>
      I am not jealous.
