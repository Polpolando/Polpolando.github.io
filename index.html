      <h4>This is a site dedicated to my own jank and bullshit while I try to distract myself by making dumb stuff on the internet</h4>
      <p>I do believe that you should first know a little bit about myself, I made a page with that exact purpose. You can navigate to it by clicking the "About me." link in the navbar at the top of the page or by clicking this <a href="/aboutme">hyperlink</a></p>
      <p>I will probably somewhat abandon this page as soon as I finish writing these last few pages but that's fine, I've got many WIP projects that I will never finish. <br>
      If you want you can also check out my other smaller projects that I have actually finished and are somewhat working by going to the "<a href="/fun">Fun stuff!</a>" page
